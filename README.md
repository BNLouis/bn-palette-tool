# bn-palette-tool

This tool allows you to easily import and edit palettes from a given spritesheet. For example, swapping colors of the palette to create alternate forms of a sprite. 

## Basic Usage

In order to use this tool, simply import a spritesheet into the app. The color palette will show up on the left and can be edited by clicking on a color in the color palette and selecting a custom color. You can also click directly on the sprite to select a color. Click Swap Colors to swap one color with another and see how it would look.

## Palette Swapping

If you have an existing sprite with a palette that you want to map to the base palette, you can import a reference sprite. This will allow you to point and click to select colors in the base sprite and the reference sprite. Once a base color and replacement color are selected, click Swap Colors to see the change immediately reflected in the base sprite.
