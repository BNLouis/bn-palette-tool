# bn-palette-tool

This tool allows you to easily edit palettes generated by the palette dumper tool. For example, swapping colors of the palette to create alternate forms of a sprite. Palettes generated by the dumper tool had to manually be edited to perform palette swaps so this tool aims to make that easier.

## Usage

In order to use this tool, you will need to provide a base palette from the palette dumper tool. A palette is a 256x1 image that contains all of the colors used in a sprite.
While not required, you should also import the grayscale file associated with the base palette. This will allow you to preview how the sprite looks when the palette is applied to the grayscaled image.

## Palette Swapping with reference image

If you have an existing sprite with a palette that you want to map to the base palette, you can import a reference sprite. This will allow you to point and click to select colors in the base sprite and the reference sprite. Once a base color and replacement color are selected, click Swap Colors to see the change immediately reflected in the base sprite.

## Add Additional Colors:

If you have an existing 256x1 color palette, you can import it using Import Additional Colors. Imported colors can be selected as a replacement color just by clicking.
